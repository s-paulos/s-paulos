- ðŸ‘‹ Hola, Iâ€™m Santiago
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of design and technology. Particularly connecting the visual with how we interact online and with devices. I'm very interested in privacy and Web 3.0. Keen on illustration, design, painting, and visual culture studies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Atomic Design and SEO.
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on diabetes related projects and/or OSS (NFT's, blockchain, DAO's).
