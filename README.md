- 👋 Hi, I’m Santiago Paulos
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of design and technology. Particularly connecting the visual with how we interact online and with devices. I’m very keen on illustration, design, painting, and visual culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Atomic Design and SEO.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on diabetes related projects and/or OSS (NFT's, blockchain, DAO's).
- 📫 Reach me at spaulos@gmail.com
